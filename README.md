Welcome to **<font size="+2">RSE@SUN</font>** - the Research Software Engineering (RSE) Group at <a href="http://www.sun.ac.za/english/data-science-and-computational-thinking/Pages/Reseach-Software-Engineering.aspx">Stellenbosch University</a>.

RSE@SUN has the distinction of being **the first dedicated RSE Group in Africa** (offering Research Software Engineering services to researchers across all Faculties and Schools within the university).<br>
<br>

<details><summary>What is an RSE?</summary>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term <b><a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/research-software-engineers">'Research Software Engineer' (RSE)</a></b> was coined by the UK-based Software Sustainability Institute in 2012, on the recognition that research is increasingly dependent on software, and that such software requires "people who <a href="https://researchsoftware.org/"><b>combine professional software expertise with an understanding of research</b></a>".</p>   

<p>Skilled RSEs support researchers in fulfilling the expectations from funders for Open Science, and funders are increasingly requiring the involvement of RSEs in data- and computationally-intensive research.</p>

<p>The important innovation of <a href="https://society-rse.org/community/rse-groups/">RSE Groups</a> established by leading UK universities pioneered <b>a novel platform to make RSE skills more widely available.</b></p>

<details><summary>What do RSEs do?</summary>
<p>
<blockquote>
   
<p>RSEs provide support to researchers (and external clients) with services ranging from <b><a href="https://rse-at-su.github.io/RSE-at-SU/#training">training</a></b>, <b><a href="https://rse-at-su.github.io/RSE-at-SU/#consulting">consultancy</a></b>, and <b><a href="https://rse-at-su.github.io/RSE-at-SU/#coding">custom code development (or rehabilitation)</a></b>.</p>

<p>RSEs assist researchers to <b>'tidy up' code in preparation for publication</b> (with code-sharing increasingly important to credibility), and help researchers establish good practices (teaching and supporting adoption of <b>collaborative version control, sustainable code development, and appropriate licensing</b>).</p>

<p>RSEs support researchers to <b>progressively transition to increasingly sophisticated levels of computational work, and explore cutting-edge technologies</b>: e.g. starting from simple scripts on a single laptop, towards reproducible analysis pipelines and HPC- or cloud-enabled Big Data analyses, simulations, or deployment of AI/ML models.</p>

<p>RSEs can work with researchers to <b>develop high-impact grant proposals</b> that leverage the advantages of software engineering in computational research, increasing the prospects of success at both the award and execution stages.</p>

## How can RSE@SUN help you?

_RSE@SUN exists to provide Stellenbosch University staff and students with coding-related training and consultancy, and software engineering support._
<br>
<br>

### Training
<blockquote>
   <br>
   Do you need a gentle introduction to the fundamentals of research computing (e.g. getting started with programming using R or Python, version control with Git, command-line control with the Unix shell)?<br>
   <br>
   Do you have some of the basics, but are now ready to cement best practices, or transition to more sophisticated research computing environments (e.g. cloud, or HPC)?
   <br>
   <br>
</blockquote>

<a href="https://carpentries.org/">**The Carpentries**</a> (Software / Data / Library Carpentry) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the development and dissemination of coding-related lessons for researchers (with workshops run by certified Instructors); **RSE@SUN staff are able to provide Carpentries workshops to Stellenbosch University staff and students**, and can provide extended workshops to promote use of the university's High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities.
<br>
<br>

### Consulting
<blockquote>
   <br>
   Do you need to bounce some ideas off a coding-savvy friend... to get a sense of 'what is possible' if software engineering skills were applied in solving your research problem?<br>
   <br>
   Do you need to satisfy a funder who wants to see evidence in your grant application that you have considered the RSE skills required to conduct the data-/computationally-intensive components of the project to a high standard?
   <br>
   <br>
</blockquote>

Dr Martin is a [Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) International Fellow](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/fellows/kim-martin), and has been awarded SSI funding to conduct a pilot program whereby 8-12 Stellenbosch University researchers will be provided with targeted consultations from UK-based RSEs, with the aim of developing RSE-related components for future grant applications (note that consultations will not form a 'full grant writing assistance' program). **This program will supplement consultations ordinarily provided by RSE@SUN staff.**
<br>
<br>

### Coding
<blockquote>
   <br>
   Do you need help setting up a reliable data capture/analysis pipeline that you will be able to confidently run in the future?<br>
   <br>
   Do you need someone with software engineering skills (and an understanding of the research environment) to work collaboratively with you in developing a custom software solution to advance your research?
   <br>
   <br>

RSE@SUN capacity and capability to **provide software engineering support** is extensible given the 'Affiliated RSE@SUN Member' (ARM) model the group employs, whereby Core Staff collaborate with Affiliated Members (Academic and Technical) depending on the expertise required.

In addition to conventional software engineering, RSE@SUN provides access to **special expertise in hardware (e.g. wireless sensors and automation)** via collaboration with Professor Thinus Booysen (Chair of IoT at Stellenbosch University).
